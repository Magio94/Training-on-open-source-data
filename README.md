# Trainings-on-open-source-data
I have entered this repository to show some of the exercises I have done independently, however they are not complete and in some even they are disorganized because they were only intended to deepen my knowledge of Python applied in particular to GIS. 

I collected here some of the trains I made to learn Python especially on geospatial data. I hope it will be useful for other people too.
